# ZaneBot - A bot which follows people on reddit and puts their messages in slack.

It's kind of a piece of crap but it mostly works, put it in a bash loop because it'll probably crash.

Copy config.js.dist to config.js and add your token and people to follow.

    npm install
    while :; do node ./bot.js ; sleep 1; done


Special thanks to Zane Tackett for being the first person who I wanted to follow :D
